# Salt.Box Bridge

## Description
Bridge component is a set of additional SaltStack modules to connect Salt
master to Salt.Box

Currently supported salt-master versions:
- 3007.13

## Salt files hierarhy

- `/srv/salt_custom/` is for user's custom files managed with Salt.Box File
  Browser
- `/srv/saltbox_salt/` is a part of Salt.Box system to replicate states from
packages
- `/srv/salt_local/` is for local Salt.Box states and modules
- `/srv/salt_master_local/` is for the Master local minion Salt.Box service states and
modules
- `/srv/salt_extmod/` is for "external modules". There are some distributed
  with this repository. It is possible to put some custom modules here also
- `/srv/sshfs/` for files to serve both as `ssh://` and `salt://`
- `/srv/migrator/` — directory of Salt files related to the migration process, accessible
  via the filebrowser when `FILEBROWSER_MIGRATOR_SOURCE_ENABLED` flag is enabled

## Installing a secondary Salt Master

The [`bin/install_master.sh`](./bin/install_master.sh) script installs Salt
and connects a new, independent `salt-master` to SaltBox via Redis. Use it to
attach a master running on its own host so it shares job data with the main SaltBox instance,
without that host's minion being managed by SaltBox master.

For a fully manual, step-by-step walkthrough of the same process see the
[Salt.Box user documentation](https://saltbox.pro/docs/next/administration/master_install).

### Requirements

- A host with network access to the SaltBox Redis instance by **IP address**
  (hostnames are not accepted by the script's prompts) and its port (`6379`
  by default)
- The `redis-ca.crt` authority certificate issued by the SaltBox instance.
  Obtain it from the SaltBox side with
  [Salt.Box Compose](https://dev.saltbox.pro/saltbox/saltbox-compose), e.g.:

  ```bash
  sudo ./bin/sb-compose.sh cp redis-salt:/etc/redis/certs/ca.crt ./redis-ca.crt
  ```

> **ATTENTION!** The script must be run as root. It installs system packages,
> writes to `/etc/salt/`, `/etc/apt/`, and enables the `salt-master` systemd
> service

### Quick start

The script is self-contained and can be copied on its own to the target
host — it clones the rest of `saltbox-bridge` itself, into a `saltbox-bridge/`
directory next to its own location:

```bash
sudo ./bin/install_master.sh
```

Use `--en_locale` or `--ru_locale` to select the language of interactive
prompts and log messages (Russian is the default). Use `-h`/`--help` to print
the full option list and a summary of what the script does.

```bash
sudo ./bin/install_master.sh --en_locale
```

### What it does

1. Installs the `redis-ca.crt` certificate (auto-detected next to the script,
   or at a path you provide) to `/etc/salt/ssl/redis-ca.crt`.
2. Checks connectivity to the SaltBox Redis instance at the IP address and
   port you provide
3. Installs required system packages (`curl`, `git`, `rsync`, `gettext`,
   etc.)
4. Installs Salt from the official APT repository
5. Creates the [Salt files hierarchy](#salt-files-hierarhy) directories
6. Clones or updates the [`saltbox-bridge`](https://dev.saltbox.pro/saltbox/saltbox-bridge)
   repository next to the script
7. Syncs Bridge files into the Salt directories above and installs the Bridge
   Python package
8. Renders `/etc/salt/master`, `/etc/salt/minion`, and `/etc/salt/saltbox`
   from the Bridge [`master/templates/`](./master/templates) files, filled in
   with the SaltBox connection details
9. Enables and restarts the `salt-master` service
10. Disables `salt-minion`, since a secondary master does not run its own minion

### Interactive prompts

During the run you will be asked to:

- provide the `redis-ca.crt` certificate — either let the script search the
  current directory automatically, or specify a path
- provide the SaltBox IP address and Redis port
- choose a Salt master ID (defaults to `master-<timestamp>`) and a log level
  for the master and the minion, selected separately on a `0`–`9` scale (see
  [Salt logging
  levels](https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/logging/index.html));
  default is `1` (`info`)
- provide the Redis username (default `redis`) and password used by the
  `saltbox` config

> **NOTE:** If a local copy of `saltbox-bridge` already exists next to the
> script, you will be asked whether to reuse it or re-clone. Re-cloning
> **PERMANENTLY DELETES** the local copy, and you will be warned separately
> if it has uncommitted changes

### Re-running the script

**The script is safe to re-run**: package installation and directory creation are
idempotent, and configs are fully re-rendered from the Bridge templates each
time.

Re-running is the **recommended** way to pick up updated Bridge templates
or to change the master ID, log levels, or Redis credentials.

## Installing Salt Evil Minions

The [`bin/install_evil.sh`](./bin/install_evil.sh) script installs and starts
[Salt Evil Minions](https://dev.saltbox.pro/saltbox/saltbox-evil-minions) — a
configurable number of evil minions connecting to a real `salt-master`.

The script is independent of `install_master.sh` and does not clone or
install `saltbox-bridge` — it only needs the Salt onedir runtime to already
be present on the host.

### Requirements

- The Salt onedir runtime already installed at
  `/opt/saltstack/salt/bin/python3` — e.g. via `install_master.sh`, or a
  regular `salt-minion`/`salt-master` package
- The **IP address** of the target master, accessible from this host via ports `4505`/`4506`

> **ATTENTION!** The script must be run as root. It writes to
> `/etc/salt/minion.d/`, `/etc/systemd/system/`, `/etc/evil-minions.env`, and
> enables the `evil-minions` and `evil-minions-restart.timer` systemd units

### Quick start

```bash
sudo ./bin/install_evil.sh
```

Use `--en_locale` or `--ru_locale` to select the language of interactive
prompts and log messages (Russian is the default). Use `-h`/`--help` to print
the full option list and a summary of what the script does.

```bash
sudo ./bin/install_evil.sh --en_locale
```

### What it does

1. Verifies that the Salt onedir runtime is present at
   `/opt/saltstack/salt/bin/python3`
2. Asks which master IP address evil-minions should connect to and how many
   evil minions to run
3. Writes `/etc/salt/minion.d/master.conf` and `/etc/salt/minion.d/waiting.conf`
   overrides
4. Clones the [`saltbox-evil-minions`](https://dev.saltbox.pro/saltbox/saltbox-evil-minions)
   repository to `/opt/saltstack/evil-minions`
5. Installs its systemd units (`evil-minions.service`,
   `evil-minions-restart.service`, `evil-minions-restart.timer`) and its
   `/etc/evil-minions.env` env file
6. Asks for the evil-minions log level
7. Enables and restarts the `evil-minions` and `evil-minions-restart.timer`
   services

### Interactive prompts

During the run you will be asked to:

- choose the target master address — either the local master on this host
  (`127.0.0.1`) or a custom **IP address**
- specify the number of evil minions to run (default `100`)
- choose a log level for evil-minions on a `1`-`5` scale (`INFO`, `WARNING`,
  `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`, `DEBUG`; default is `1`/`INFO`)

> **NOTE:** re-running the script re-clones `saltbox-evil-minions` from
> deleting any local copy and re-renders the minion overrides,
> systemd units, and evn file
